- [x] Coroutines for background processing
- [x] Jetpack Navigation for navigation between screens
- [x] Jetpack ViewModel and LifeCycle for the architecture
- [x] LiveData and Data Binding for the communication between components
- [x] Room database for local storage
- [x] Retrofit for network access
- [x] Coil for download of images
- [x] Timber for logging
- [ ] Hilt for dependency injection

This is still a work in progress.
